# demo-projects-python
Here is a showcase of personal projects & academic assignments

The programs committed here are to *build a portfolio* of coding projects for the purpose of *sharing my work with others*. 

Brief description of each program:


**basic_timer** - First Python project ever made. A personal project both for fun and learning.


**capstone_project** - A formally assigned Python project. It was academically assigned which aided in deciding on what concepts to implement.

Current contributions focused mainly on:

- Correct and consistent spacing, following PEP8 guidelines.
- Concise naming conventions that are descriptive and consistent with PEP8.
- Comments that explain code and are consistent with PEP8 guidelines.
- Error handling.
- Functions.
- Nested loops and advanced data management.
- Concise use of repetition structures. 
- Creative use of random module.

More to come!
